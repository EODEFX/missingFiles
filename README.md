This is a python script to help find missing files after a batch render. You browse to any frame numbered file that is deliminated using a name.####.ext numbering system. Then specify which frames you want to check. Then click find files. It will print the file name, missing frames, and total missing. You can browse to another file, and repeat the process for different render layers or outputs.
